## Architecture

* **Docker Engine**
* **Docker Deamon(Docker D)** - is a service to manage containers. Docker D Uses Container D bhind the scene

    **Container D** - is a tool to make containers. 

* **Docker CLI -** Takes command as an input and send it to execute on Docker D.
  * Command -> Docker CLI -> Docker Engine( Docker D -> Container D )
* **Dcoker Client(Docker Desktop) -** It directly communicates with docker engine using API's and show the container details in GUI.
